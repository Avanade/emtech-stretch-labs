This license applies to all patents owned or controlled by You, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by making, having made, using, selling, offering for sale, importing or otherwise transferring of Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with any Material.

You reserve the right to revoke the patent license stated in the section above if We make any infringement claim that is targeted at your Contribution and not asserted for a Defensive Purpose. An assertion of claims of the Patents shall be considered for a "Defensive Purpose" if the claims are asserted against an entity that has filed, maintained, threatened, or voluntarily participated in a patent infringement lawsuit against Us or any of Our licensees.

## Project Obligations
We agree to license the Contribution only under the terms of the license or licenses that We are using on the Submission Date for the Material (including any rights to adopt any future version of a license).

We agree to license patents owned or controlled by You only to the extent necessary to (sub)license Your Contribution(s) and the combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Material under the terms of the license or licenses that We are using on the Submission Date.

## Disclaimer
THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US AND BY US TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION AND EXTENT TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD AND EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

## Consequential Damage
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.

## Approximation of disclaimer and damage waiver
IF THE DISCLAIMER AND DAMAGE WAIVER MENTIONED IN SECTION 5. AND SECTION 6. CANNOT BE GIVEN LEGAL EFFECT UNDER APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW, REVIEWING COURTS SHALL APPLY LOCAL LAW THAT MOST CLOSELY APPROXIMATES AN ABSOLUTE WAIVER OF ALL CIVIL OR CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTRIBUTION.

## Term

This Agreement shall apply for the term of the copyright and patents licensed here. However, You shall have the right to terminate the Agreement if We do not fulfill the project obligations.

In the event of a termination of this Agreement, the Disclaimer, Consequential Damage and Approximation of disclaimer and damage waiver sections shall survive such termination and shall remain in full force thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, Free and Open Source Software (sub)licenses that have already been granted for Contributions at the date of the termination shall remain in full force after the termination of this Agreement.
