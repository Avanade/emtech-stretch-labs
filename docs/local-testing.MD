# Local Testing

## NextMind Integration

The `nextmind-testharness` folder uses `ngrok` to run a local server to listen to messages from nextmind, and display them.

Run `python testserver.py` in the `nextmind-testharness` folder.

## Speech Integration

The `text-to-speech` folder in `control-agent` overwrites the object detection demo to allow text-to-speech integration.

Follow [instructions](control-agent/text-to-speech/Stretch/README.md) to run locally on the stretch platform
